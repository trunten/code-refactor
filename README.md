# Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge

## Description - Project detail

- I was given this project and I was asked to organise and refactor it. but, crucially, leaving the design and content intact.
- I added semantic tags to make the content more accessible to people with disabilities and to improve search engine optimisation.
- Several CSS declaratiogns were also removed and consolidated into single sections that follow the new semantic tags.
- Comments were added to the CSS file to make the code more readable and understandable.
- id attributes were added to several elements to make in-page links functional
