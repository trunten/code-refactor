# Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge

## Project detail

- I was given this project and I was asked to organise and refactor it.

- I added semantic tags to make the content more accessible to people with disabilities and to improve search engine optimisation.

- Several CSS declarations were also removed and consolidated into single sections that follow the new semantic tags.

- Comments were added to the CSS file to make the code more readable and understandable.
